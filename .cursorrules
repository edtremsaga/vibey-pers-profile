# Cursor Rules for vibey pers profile

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE - MUST FOLLOW ⚠️

**NEVER make code changes without following this workflow:**

### REQUIRED Steps Before ANY Code Changes:

1. **EXPLAIN**: Clearly describe what you understand the user is asking for
   - Summarize the request in your own words
   - List what files/functions will be affected
   - Describe the expected behavior/outcome

2. **WAIT**: Explicitly wait for user confirmation
   - Use phrases like "Should I proceed?" or "Does this sound correct?"
   - DO NOT proceed until user explicitly confirms with words like:
     - "proceed"
     - "yes"
     - "go ahead"
     - "implement"
     - "that's correct"
     - "do it"

3. **THEN CODE**: Only after explicit confirmation, proceed with code changes

### HARD STOPS:

- ❌ NEVER use `search_replace`, `write`, `edit_file`, or any code editing tools until user confirms
- ❌ NEVER assume agreement - always wait for explicit confirmation
- ❌ NEVER skip the explanation step, even for "simple" requests
- ✅ ALWAYS explain first, wait for confirmation, then code

### Checklist Format (use this structure):

```
## Understanding:
[Your explanation of what user wants]

## Proposed Changes:
[What files/functions you'll modify]

## Awaiting Confirmation:
[Wait for user to explicitly confirm before proceeding]
```

**This rule applies to ALL requests, no exceptions.**
